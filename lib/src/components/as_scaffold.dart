/// A platform-adaptive scaffold that automatically uses [CupertinoPageScaffold]
/// on iOS/macOS platforms and [Scaffold] on other platforms.
///
/// This widget provides a unified API that works across platforms while
/// maintaining native look and feel. When on Cupertino platforms (iOS/macOS),
/// it renders a [CupertinoPageScaffold] with [CupertinoNavigationBar].
/// On Material platforms (Android, etc.), it renders a standard [Scaffold].
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// ASScaffold(
///   appBar: AppBar(title: Text('My App')),
///   body: Center(child: Text('Hello World')),
///   floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
///     onPressed: () {},
///     child: Icon(Icons.add),
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
